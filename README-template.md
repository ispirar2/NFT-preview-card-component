## My process
The first thing was analyzing the design and figuring out the margins and the font size 
then I started to writing the html file and added the body basic design and after that
I started to implement the designs in css to make it look as much as possible identical 
to the design and I had some problems making the img hover effect and I wasn't able to-  
pull it off if you have aby suggestions please write them in the comments.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Hover effect 

### What I learned
I have learned how to make hover effect on html links I didn't know it was so easy to do 
and I learned how to use the right amount of containers and not to over do them
### Continued development
I want to continue learning about hover effect and other css effects so I can make better looking designs
